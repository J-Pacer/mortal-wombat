Which features should I focus on next?

Bug: 
Inputs in panes flicker and lose focus when world is edited
Don't select words when double clicking things
Possible to interact with diagonal tiles even when adjacent tiles are solid
Holes in lava can make you fall through world (but students really like this bug)

Features:
- To see where people's cursors are in the editor, or where they are looking
- Protected regions in world so no one accidentally messes up someone else's stuff
- hover over a block and see who edited it last
- Rectangular selection tool for filling, moving, deleting, cut, paste, things in bulk
- shift+click to delete
- mini map
- click where to start when testing
- editor performance

Game features:
- Poop bar, poop blocks, so much poop
- fall damage?
- gem counter
